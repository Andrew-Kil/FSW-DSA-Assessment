# FSW DSA Assessment

This is an assessment designed to get a baseline understanding of your current knowledge and skill level. You will complete a series of problems, some of which require specific Data Structures & Algorithms knowledge.

The problems are ordered from easiest to hardest, so it's recommended you attempt them in that order.

## About Testing

This repository uses automated tests to check your answers (similar to the way leetcode and codewars operate). The tests are written using `jest`, a javascript testing framework. The number of tests you can get to pass will count as your score for the evaluation. 

All of the problems have more than 1 test, so you may be able to get partial credit even if you don't get the right answer.

## Setup

* Fork and clone this repository
* `cd` to the cloned directory
* `npm install` to install the dependencies

## Instructions

Solve each of the problems in the `problems.js` file. Each problem has its own description directly above it. Read the description and write your code in the empty function.

Run `npm test` as often as you want to see how many tests you've passed. You will start off with 0 passing. Read the output of the tests carefully to get information about what you need to do.

You may:

* Add other functions as necessary to solve each problem (but not external libraries or npm packages)
* Read the `problems.test.js` file to get more clarity on what the tests are looking for (but it may be confusing, in which case don't worry about it)

You may NOT:

* Modify the `problems.test.js` file in any way.
* Modify the function names in `problems.js`
* Modify the function signatures in `problems.js` (the function signature is how many arguments each function has)
